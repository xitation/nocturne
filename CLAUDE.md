# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Nocturne is a .NET 10 rewrite of the Nightscout diabetes management API with 1:1 API compatibility with the legacy JavaScript implementation. API versions v1, v2, and v3 maintain compatibility with the original Nightscout API; v4 is new.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start the full stack (API + PostgreSQL + Web + services)
aspire start

# Build solution
dotnet build

# Run unit tests (excludes integration/performance)
dotnet test --filter "Category!=Integration&Category!=Performance"

# Run a single test class
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~EntryServiceTests"

# Run integration tests (requires Docker)
cd tests/Infrastructure/Docker && docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration"

# Frontend type checking
cd src/Web/packages/app && pnpm run check

# Regenerate just the NSwag TypeScript client
dotnet build -t:GenerateClient src/API/Nocturne.API/Nocturne.API.csproj

# EF Core migrations (must disable NSwag first)
dotnet build -p:GenerateNSwagClient=false
dotnet ef migrations add <Name> -p src/Infrastructure/Nocturne.Infrastructure.Data -s src/API/Nocturne.API
```

Aspire orchestrates everything: PostgreSQL, the API, the SvelteKit frontend, and background services. A YARP gateway is the single external HTTPS endpoint; API and Web run as plain HTTP behind it. You only need to restart Aspire if its `Program.cs` changes. The NSwag client is regenerated automatically on Aspire startup. If you come across a roadblock from the `.dll`s being in use, just kill the dotnet processes.

### Generated API Client Files

Generated files in `src/Web/packages/app/src/lib/api/generated/` are tracked in git so they're browsable on GitHub. CI regenerates and commits them on every merge to main. Locally, Aspire regenerates them on startup which dirties the working tree. To suppress this noise:

```bash
cd src/Web && pnpm run hide-generated   # set --skip-worktree (one-time after clone)
cd src/Web && pnpm run unhide-generated # undo if you need to stage generated changes
```

The `--skip-worktree` bits may be cleared by git during branch switches that touch those files. Re-run `hide-generated` if generated files reappear in `git status`.

### Worktrees

Git worktrees are supported. In the main checkout, `aspire start` uses persistent Postgres (named volume, pgAdmin) and binds the gateway to `https://localhost:1612`. In a worktree, Postgres is automatically ephemeral (anonymous volume, no pgAdmin) and ports are dynamic.

**Always use `--isolated` when running Aspire from a worktree** to avoid dashboard port collisions with the main instance:

```bash
aspire run --isolated
```

`--isolated` randomizes all Aspire infrastructure ports (dashboard, OTLP, resource service) and creates isolated user secrets. Without it, the worktree shares `launchSettings.json` ports with main and will fail to start if main is already running.

To force persistent mode in a worktree (e.g. long-lived debugging): `NOCTURNE_DB_PERSISTENCE=persistent aspire run --isolated`.

## Architecture

Nocturne follows Clean Architecture.

### API Client Generation Pipeline

Three-stage pipeline runs as MSBuild post-build targets on the API project:

1. **NSwag** generates OpenAPI spec → TypeScript client interfaces (`nswag.json`)
2. **Zod schema generator** creates validators from the OpenAPI spec
3. **openapi-remote-codegen** generates SvelteKit server remote functions from controller endpoints marked with [RemoteQuery], [RemoteCommand], or [RemoteFormData] attributes

Output lands in `src/Web/packages/app/src/lib/api/generated/`. The MetadataController exists solely to expose types to NSwag that aren't otherwise reachable through endpoints.

### Timestamp Handling

Domain models use **mills-first** timestamps. `Entry.Mills` (Unix milliseconds) is the source of truth; `Entry.Date` and `Entry.DateString` are computed properties.

## Database

- **PostgreSQL** via Entity Framework Core with 70+ migrations
- Domain models → Database entities via mappers in `Infrastructure.Data/Mappers/`
- Tables use snake_case (`entries`, `treatments`)
- UUID v7 for new records; `OriginalId` preserved for MongoDB migration compatibility
- Row Level Security for multitenancy

### Row Level Security

Tenant-scoped tables enforce isolation via PostgreSQL Row Level Security.
Two roles are used:

- `nocturne_migrator` — owns the schema, runs migrations. NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS.
- `nocturne_app` — runtime DbContext pool. Owns nothing. NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS.
- `nocturne_web` — SvelteKit web app's bot-framework state (`chat_state_*`
  tables created on first run by `@chat-adapter/state-pg`). Owns only those
  tables. NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS. The `chat_state_*` tables are
  intentionally NOT tenant-scoped and NOT covered by RLS — they're keyed by
  chat-platform IDs (Discord user ID, Telegram chat ID, etc.) and hold no
  PHI. PHI is only ever fetched over HTTP through the Nocturne API, which
  enforces RLS server-side. NOBYPASSRLS on the role is defense in depth.

FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY is enabled on every tenant-scoped table, so even
the migrator obeys policies. **Data migrations cannot SELECT or UPDATE
tenant-scoped tables without first setting the tenant context**:

    SELECT set_config('app.current_tenant_id', '<uuid>', false);
    -- then query/update

Schema-only migrations (CREATE/ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX, etc.) are
unaffected. If a data migration needs to touch multiple tenants, loop over
tenants and set the GUC per iteration.

Roles are created by `docs/postgres/container-init/00-init.sh` (container
init, bind-mounted into the Postgres container) or
`docs/postgres/bootstrap-roles.sql` (bring-your-own PostgreSQL, run once
manually as superuser). The BYO script is intentionally NOT in the
container-init directory — it refuses to run with placeholder passwords
and would abort container startup if Postgres picked it up. Never GRANT
BYPASSRLS to either role.

## Testing

- **xUnit** + **FluentAssertions** + **Moq**
- Tests mirror source structure: `tests/Unit/Nocturne.{Project}.Tests/`
- `[Trait("Category", "Integration")]` for integration tests
- Integration tests use `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` and Testcontainers

## Web Frontend

- **SvelteKit 2** / **Svelte 5** (runes), **Tailwind CSS 4**, **shadcn-svelte**, **layerchart**, **Zod 4**
- **pnpm** workspaces (Node.js 24+, pnpm 9+)

## Local Container Build

`scripts/build.cs` (run via `dotnet run scripts/build.cs`) mirrors the CI pipeline locally: restores .NET, generates the API client (NSwag + Zod + remote codegen), verifies generated files, and builds both containers. Without `--push`, images are loaded into the local Docker daemon. `scripts/publish-release.cs` generates the production Docker Compose bundle (compose + `.env.example` + init script) that gets attached to GitHub Releases.

## Code Style Requirements

- **Backend is source of truth.** No calculations, categorization, or color computation on the frontend.
- **No frontend-only models.** All TypeScript interfaces derive from the NSwag-generated client.
- **Always use remote functions**, never raw fetch/requests on the frontend. Use the remote functions attribute to automatically generate type-safe API calls with Zod validation.
- **Strings/messages live on the frontend** (translation layer).
- **No emoji.** Use Lucide icons for UI elements.
