# Nocturne

A modern, high-performance diabetes management platform built with .NET 10. Nocturne is a complete rewrite of the Nightscout API with full feature parity, providing native C# implementations of all endpoints with optimized performance and modern cloud-native architecture.

## What is Nocturne?

Nocturne is a comprehensive diabetes data platform that provides:

- **Complete Nightscout API Implementation** - All Nightscout endpoints natively implemented in C# with full compatibility
- **Data Connectors** - Native integration with major diabetes platforms (Dexcom, Glooko, LibreLinkUp, MiniMed CareLink, MyFitnessPal, Nightscout)
- **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket/SignalR support for live glucose readings and alerts
- **Advanced Analytics** - Comprehensive glucose statistics, time-in-range calculations, and reports
- **Cloud-Native** - Built on Aspire for seamless local development and cloud deployment

## Quick Start with Aspire (Development)

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) or later
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Node.js 24+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm 9+](https://pnpm.io/)

Aspire orchestrates all services with a single command:

```bash
aspire start
```

Aspire will automatically:

- Start PostgreSQL in a container
- Run database migrations
- Start the Nocturne API and SvelteKit frontend
- Launch any configured data connectors
- Set up service discovery, health checks, and a YARP gateway

Once running, open the Aspire dashboard link from the console output to see all services. Access the app at `https://localhost:1612`.

## Multitenancy (Custom Local Domain)

By default, Aspire serves the app at `https://localhost:1612`. This works for single-tenant development but **WebAuthn passkeys fail on tenant subdomains** because browsers reject `localhost` as a passkey Relying Party ID for subdomain origins.

To test multitenancy with passkeys locally:

**1. Install mkcert**

```bash
# Windows
winget install FiloSottile.mkcert

# macOS
brew install mkcert

# Linux — use your distro's package manager
```

**2. Set the custom domain**

```bash
cd src/Aspire/Nocturne.Aspire.Host
dotnet user-secrets set "LocalDev:Domain" "nocturne.test"
```

**3. Add hosts file entries**

Add lines to your hosts file (`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows, `/etc/hosts` on macOS/Linux):

```
127.0.0.1  nocturne.test
127.0.0.1  demo.nocturne.test
127.0.0.1  riley.nocturne.test
```

Add one line per tenant slug you want to use. Hosts files don't support wildcards.

**4. Start Aspire**

```bash
aspire start
```

Aspire will automatically generate a wildcard TLS certificate for `*.nocturne.test`, install the mkcert CA into your system trust store, and configure the YARP gateway to use it. Access the app at `https://nocturne.test`.

## Production Deployment (Docker Compose)

The easiest way to deploy Nocturne is with the production Docker Compose bundle. Each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/nightscout/nocturne/releases) includes ready-to-use artifacts, or you can generate them locally.

### Using a release

Download `docker-compose.yaml` and `.env.example` from the [latest release](https://github.com/nightscout/nocturne/releases).

```bash
# 1. Copy the env template and fill in your passwords and domain
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Start Nocturne
docker compose up -d
```

The production compose includes [Watchtower](https://github.com/nicholas-fedor/watchtower) for automatic container updates (checks daily), and omits the Aspire dashboard and Scalar API explorer. Watchtower will automatically pull new images as they are published — no manual updates needed.

### Generating locally

If you have the .NET 10 SDK and Aspire CLI installed, you can generate the production bundle from source:

```bash
dotnet run scripts/publish-release.cs              # outputs to ./release-output
dotnet run scripts/publish-release.cs ./deploy     # or specify a directory
```

### PostgreSQL Roles

Nocturne uses three separate PostgreSQL roles for defense in depth. All three have `NOBYPASSRLS` so they obey Row Level Security policies, even when the database has no superuser connected.

| Role                    | Purpose                                                                                | Privileges                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`nocturne_migrator`** | Runs EF Core migrations (schema DDL). Owns the database and `public` schema.           | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` on tables. Cannot bypass RLS.                                                        |
| **`nocturne_app`**      | Runtime connection pool for the .NET API. Owns nothing.                                | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on migrator-created tables. Cannot bypass RLS.                          |
| **`nocturne_web`**      | SvelteKit bot framework (chat state storage). Owns only its own `chat_state_*` tables. | `CREATE` on `public` schema (for its own tables only). No access to Nocturne tenant tables. Cannot bypass RLS. |

The bootstrap user (`POSTGRES_USER`) is only used for initial container setup. After `container-init/00-init.sh` runs, all application traffic flows through the three roles above. Passwords are set via environment variables in `.env`.

For bring-your-own PostgreSQL (not using the bundled container), run `docs/postgres/bootstrap-roles.sql` once as a superuser. See the comments in that file for details.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run unit tests only
dotnet test --filter "Category!=Integration&Category!=Performance"

# Run with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Create a new migration
cd src/Infrastructure/Nocturne.Infrastructure.Data
dotnet ef migrations add YourMigrationName

# Apply migrations
dotnet ef database update
```

## API Documentation

API documentation is available via [Scalar](https://scalar.com/) at `https://localhost:1612/scalar` when running locally.

Nocturne aims to match Nightscout's API 1:1, so any Nightscout API endpoint should be usable. Nocturne-only endpoints are scoped to v4.
